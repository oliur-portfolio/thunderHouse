                                ThunderHouse traces its brand heritage to the
                                greatest of all American innovators, Benjamin
                                Franklin. His focus was the practical
                                application of science to solving everyday
                                problems and making peoples' lives better.
                                Franklin created the postal system, the lending
                                library, the first fire department, the Franklin
                                stove, bifocals and most relevant to
                                ThunderHouse, he discovered the connection
                                between lightning and electricity.

                                In the mid-1700s, Franklin applied what he
                                learned from his kite-flying experiments to the
                                invention of the lightning rod, to prevent the
                                destruction of buildings and lives. But as with
                                many innovations, before and after, Franklin
                                could not sell the concept: lightning was
                                considered a divine act and interfering with it
                                was sacrilege.

                                Franklin was undeterred. He built a
                                ThunderHouse, a brilliant "demo" to communicate
                                the benefit of his lightning rod and break the
                                barriers to its acceptance. The "ThunderHouse" -
                                a three-dimensional wooden model house, equipped
                                with a lightning rod, hinged walls and a
                                detachable roof. Inside, Franklin placed a small
                                charge of gunpowder.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When an electric charge was applied to the
                                lightning rod, electricity would pass safely
                                through the rod and grounding wire to the earth
                                with no effect. However, when a wooden block was
                                positioned to break the grounding circuit, a
                                spark across the block would ignite the
                                gunpowder with convincing and entertaining
                                effects - the roof and walls literally blew off!
